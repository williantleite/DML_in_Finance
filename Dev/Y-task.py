# Y task modelling

# Isnt the data gonna be too little for running each specific fund? Probably, so in that case we either have to increase the time range (which even then may not solve the issue), or we aggregate them first (weighted average), and run the RNN in the total data. 

#In fact, thinking better, I do not believe that aggregating them would solve the issue either given that would still limit the data to 432 rows. Our data is wide, not long, so what solution could we get here? Im not sure to be honest.
